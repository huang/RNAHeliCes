1. the BFS energy calculation can only use the Turner1999 parameters, extend it to different parameters
2. ==18330== 208,848 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 1 of 1
   ==18330==    at 0x4C279F2: calloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:467)
   ==18330==    by 0x5099421: space (utils.c:45)

3. the result list with -p is different from the one without -p (microstate and macrostate grammars yield different energy results)
4. ./RNAHeliCes ../examples/ires_picornaviridae.fa -u -k 2 -t 2 -r 2 ==> Segmentation fault 
5. integrate hienergy barrier tree function into hipath.cc
6. Write new hishape data structure for gap-file 

7. consider for rule 2, replace the map with hash_map
8. check if the record search used hash_map in rule 2 --> potential runtime improvement
9. ./RNAHeliCes: error while loading shared libraries: comp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

     - src/libs/liblapack.a and src/libs/libblas.a are from Linear Algebra routines, these may be system dependent. If so, please reload them from Linear Algebra PACKage.

sudo yum install libgfortran libf2c blas lapack

11. add option for rule1 in RNALocMin: -x [ --thresh ] [=arg(=10000)]   Specifiy a threshold value for initstem

12. NOTE current HiEAPath is dependant on RNAeval, so it causes problem. bind the program directly with library RNAeval

13.
The flag -std=c++0x gives you access to whatever c++11 functionality is implemented in your version of gcc. For random number distributions, c++11 has the header random. You do not need the tr1 namespace when using c++11.

The tr1 version of random is in include tr1/random, and everything there is under the std::tr1 namespace. To access this you do not need the c++0x flag.

To be clear:

For TR1 random numbers: #include <tr1/random> and use std::tr1::normal_distribution.

For c++11 random numbers: compile with flag c++0x, then #include <random> and use std::normal_distribution.



14. IMPORTANT TODO: using --minh doesn't work out of ./src directory
15. delete src/HiKinetics, since new version of HiKinetics exists under modified_software_and_scripts
