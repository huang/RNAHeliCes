Quickstart
------------
1. Read deps and install the dependent compilers and packages
2. Type
     ./configure
     make
     make install
   to configure, make and install RNAHeliCes, HiPath and HiTed
   Notes:
     - If there are any linking problems after installing, please check if /usr/local/lib is contained in the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
     - ./src/libs/libRNA.a contains all Vienna package routines, this may be system dependent. If so, please reload this from Vienna RNA Package.
3. Type './src/RNAHeliCes ./examples/collosoma_slrna.seq' to run an example.
4. Type './src/HiPath -h' to get help for calculating energy barriers of an energy landscape.
   Type './src/HiPath -f ./examples/alternating_rna.faa -t 1 -P ./src/librna/vienna/rna_turner1999.par' to run an example.
5. Type './src/HiTed -h' to get help for calculating minimum Hishape based Tree edit distance.
   Type './src/HiTed ./examples/riboswitches.fas -t 1 -r 1' to run an example.
6. See ./HiKinetics/README for HiKinetics.

See 
    "INSTALL"        for detailed installation instructions, and
    "COPYING"        for disclaimer and copyright.
